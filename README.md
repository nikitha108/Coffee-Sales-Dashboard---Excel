## Data Cleaning and Transformation

This stage commenced with establishing a functional worksheet and converting the datasets from various sheets into "Tables". Subsequently, we began a thorough examination of the data, scrutinizing for any potential data quality issues, including:

- Conducting checks for NULL values, blanks, and errors.
- Eliminating duplicates and irrelevant columns.
- Ensuring data consistency and cleanliness regarding data type, format, and values.
- Employing the # VLOOKUP function to retrieve customer information such as name, email, country, as well as coffee-related details including type, roast, size, and unit price from the respective customer and products tables.
- Deriving the "Sales" column through calculation and generating the "Coffee Type Name" and "Roast Type Name" columns using the IF function.

## Data Analysis

3 pivot tables were created to summarise the data and help identify trends in the dataset focusing on relationship between sales and other factors such as date, customers, country. Also the Top 5 customers were also identified

## Data Visualization

Finally, the dashboard was created by inserting and customizing the pivot charts of corresponding pivot table on a separate sheet named “Dashboard”. For user friendly and interactive experience 3 "Slicers" and 1 “Timeline” were added.

Below is a snippet of the final dashboard in Excel.
